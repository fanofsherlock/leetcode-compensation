Recently I received an offer from Microsoft Hyderabad for the SDE 2 role.
I cleared all 6 rounds of interviews & here comes the offer.
First of all with my experience which is more than 6, they have offered me L 61, but I am looking for L 62. Second the compensation is much lower than market standard, let's even forget the top tier company part.
Compensation : Base= 27Lac
Bonus = 5.8Lac
Stocks = 40K USD = 10K USD per year = 7.5 LPA Per year
Signing Bonus = 2Lac + 1.5 Relocation
Total Yearly = 27+6+7 =40 ~ 41 LPA
has anyone faced the same ?
And how exactly , I should go with it. Any suggestion comments would be much appreciated.
