Hi Leetcoders,
I have chargebee offer.
TC : 43 LPA
Joining bonus : 2 lacs
Ridiculous thing is that, they have included everything in the total compensation like WFH allowance, telephone and internet rembursement.
Should I accept this offer?
Total experience : 6 years 1 month
Current compensation : 28 LPA (25 fixed) other benefits are not included those benefits are being provided separately
Any suggestion will be highly appreciated.
PS : I will update the interview experience very soon.
