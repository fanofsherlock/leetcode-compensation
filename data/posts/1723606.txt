Hi Folks, I have offers from Swisscom (Rotterdam) and EPAM (Singapore). Following are the details -
Education: B.E. from Tier-2
Years of Experience: 7+
Prior Experience: Glance (Inmobi Group Compnay)
Position: SDE 2
Current Compensation: 40L INR (+500 ESOPS spread over 4 years) + other standard benefits
Date of the below Offers: Jan 2022
Swisscom - Compensation
Role : Full Stack Developer
Fixed : 70K EUR
Stocks - none
Variable Pay - none yet, in works but max will be a months salary
Relocation Bonus - 4K EUR (60% clawback if left before 1 year)
Total comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): ~74K EUR
Benefits: 25 paid vacation days + unlimited paid sick leave days (expected to use this wisely for short sickness i.e. a day or two at stretch, for more than that proper doctor application is required) + + 1 personal days + monthly gym membership reimburshment of 20 EUR + covered health/dental/vision (Netherland Standard Insurance - paid by employee)
Other details: Tried negotiating with them but they have a set standard for new employee to start at 100% of the position range and they didn't budge
EPAM - Compensation
Role : Backend Developer
Fixed : 96K SGD
Stocks - none
Variable Pay - 5% ~ 4.5K SGD
Relocation Bonus - 4K SGD (full clawback if left before 2 year)
Total comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): ~104K SGD
Benefits: 15 paid vacation days + 14 paid sick leave days + paid Singapore holidays + covered health/dental/vision (Singapore Standard Insurance - paid by employer)
Other details: Already negotiated with EPAM and it's on the higher end as per them for the position
Considering both offers, i'm inclined to join Swisscom, as EU has a better WLB and it's not a service based contracted role. EPAM on the other hand will have multiple clients and i'll have to work accordingly. But i'm still thinking that is it a wise choice or not! Hence the post here.
If you guys have got any pointers with respect to culture, WLB and work pressure in both companies, please help me out here.
