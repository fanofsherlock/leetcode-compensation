Considering all offers have almost similar compensation. I want to focus on the other aspects like WLB and culture. I'm inclined to join company providing WFH, on the other hand should l leave Maersk(product based) and join Service based. But i'm still thinking that is it a wise choice or not!
My Hometown is 1500 KM away from Bangalore, if I join Maersk I have to travel to Bangalore.
If you guys have got any pointers with respect to culture, WLB and work pressure in these companies.
Please help me out here to select which one should I join.
