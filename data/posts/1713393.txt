College- IIT
Experience- 0
I would be joining consumer and wealth management division.
base is 21 lpa
Supplementary salary - 6.5 l (applicable only in the first year of joining)
One time payment - 7 l
No stocks
I have an another offer from a software firm (not naming the company for anonymity) with good work life balance to my knowledge. But the offer is not even near to that of goldman.
Base is 13lpa and 30k USD worth equity vested over 4 years.
So If anyone can share their insigths on this (Which would be better), I would be very grateful .
Thank you
