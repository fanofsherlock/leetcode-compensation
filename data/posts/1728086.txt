2022 grad here.
Recently, I received a SDE-1 offer from both Amazon and Flipkart for SDE 1 role.
Amazon CTC: 44 L
Flipkart CTC: 32.57L
Although Amazon has a higher CTC, I feel more inclined to join Flipkart because it is nearer to its IPO and also its base pay (18L) is higher than Amazon (15.5L) ?
I was wondering if being a fresher right out of college, I can negotiate with the HR regarding increasing the Flipkart total compensation ? And is it correct decision to join FK over AMZ ?
Thanks
