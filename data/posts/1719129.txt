HI Everyone,
I have got offers from Oracle OCI as MTS and from Groww as SDE 2.
Oracle OCI - salary(fixed+Bonus+stock) = 50(33+6+11)
Stock is of 46lakh for 4 years 700rsu.
Groww - salary(fixed+ Bonus+ variable +ESOPS) = 49(38+2+3+6lakh)
My prior experince is with startups only no big organization, but the issue with Oracle is its fixed component is quite less than Groww. and also I have heared that with Oracle there is issue with hikes and all.
I am confused which I should join? Please do suggest.
