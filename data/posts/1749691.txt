I have appraisal coming next month. I am a Data Scientist from Tier1 college having 2.5 years of Work Experience with 16 LPA as base, and hadn't negotiated at all while joining due to fear of losing the offer.
Is the number as per what market would offer currently? What is a decent base salary according to you? Any thoughts would be helpful.
