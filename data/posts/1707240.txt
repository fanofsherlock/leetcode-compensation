The hiring manager was pretty interested in having me in his team. And He promised there won't be as much on-calls and the work timing should be reasonable in his team. Got to know from the recruiter that all interviewers gave 'Strong hire'. This is the initial offer. Have not done any negotiations.
The team is reasonably good and the manager also is interested? I have not worked on python so far. I love writing code in Scala and Java. Will this tech stack be a concern. I am looking to stay in the next company for at least 3 years. And I have offers from Tekion and Meesho(Almost similar package, will add them in the coming days).
Considering all this, Is it a good decision to join Rippling?
