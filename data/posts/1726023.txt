I have interned in 2 companies as SDE Intern. And got rejected 2 times in a row while giving PPO.
1 was faang and other was a startup.
I have completed multiple projects there, deployed 1000s of lines of code in production. But still I got to hear very silly excuses at the end. Due to these betrayals, I'm jobless now. There are 4 months remaining till I graduate.
I was very good, but suddenly I'm now destroyed. I'm better than most, but not getting good opportunities now.
What can I do...?
I write 100s of cold emails, uncountable linkedin DMs and infinite apply everywhere. But no success till now. I'm very worried.
I can clear any interview, I have solved 1000s of problems over various platforms.
Can someone please help me?
