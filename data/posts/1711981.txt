Hi!, I recently got an offer from Cognizant as a Data Engineer Role.
It consists of three rounds
Technical MCQS
Coding Round
Technical and HR Round
Questions asked in the first round were of medium level. Questions in this round covered from the topics {OOPS, ERROR DETECTION, FILLING MISSING CODES, SQL}
Three Questions were asked in Coding Round, where each question consisted of 2 questions.
First two questions were problem solving one and were of medium level.
almost all questions were about DP and GREEDY
The Third Question was SQL related and was a moderate Question as well
I was qualified in the First Round and was Qualified to the second Round. I answered Two questions of Three coding questions, I couldnt attend Third question which was SQL related.
In next few days, I recieved a Mail regarding Second Round qualification.
Technical Round was little easy for me, because interviewer was very friendly. He asked me basic coding questions and concepts like OOPS and DBMS
Finally, I recieved a mail regarding selecting process.
**TIPS FROM MY EXPERIENCE **
Dont stop coding, solve as much as you can everyday
Dont Learn too many concepts at a time
Stick to one programming language
Learn by doing, I mean projects
Dont jump to the answer early, Atleast stick to a problem for an hour
Read others Code or watch Youtube (This is the most important tip from my experience)
AGAIN!, practice, practice, practice...
BEST OF LUCK
