Tried negotiating a lot on TC, But seems like they won't let in [HR was a bit rude too]
Verdict:
Did not join
Reasons:
- Start up - so it will be 0 WLB,
- Pay is not that great, No equities too,
- Small team [around 100 people in the Engineering teams]
- Doesn't seem like a Employee centric Org [So doubting a good work culture]
