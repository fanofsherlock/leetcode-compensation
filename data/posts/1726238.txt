Current experience:
CTC : 24 lacs + 7 lacs worth esops
Years of experience : 5+
I have received offers from Tekion and Freshworks.
I'm confused on which company to join.
I value wlb and culture which is good in freshworks, however they are offering a very low balled offer compared to Tekion.
I have asked for better base but they seems adamant for now.
As per the experiences shared by employees online Tekion seems to have pretty bad WLB.
Anybody can tell me which one should I join? How bad is the WLB in tekion?
Compensation:
Tekion - 33 Base + 2 lakh bonus (one time, first year) + 4000 units ESOPs
Freshworks - 28 Base + 10 lakh bonus (split eqally over 2 years)
