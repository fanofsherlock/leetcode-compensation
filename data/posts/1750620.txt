This is the shittiest company on earth.

It is the worst place to work if you are a tech guy.
If you ever think of switching here then change your mind.
Founders are very toxic and abusive. Very highly toxic work culture.
I have wasted a lot of my precious time working in this startup.
Guys, I request you to stay away from this useless startup.
And if you work here, then switch now, otherwise you will stuck in a fucked up loop and your life will become dark like hell.
