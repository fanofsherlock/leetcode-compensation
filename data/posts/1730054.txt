First of all, I interviewed for SDE2 - L61 position but they are offering L60 which I don't know why.
I am definitely being low-balled here. I have just received the offer and didn't start negotiation yet. I have asked HR to bump the level but he was giving explanations related to performance in the interviews. Then he said at your YOE people get L60 only. I told them that it is not the case so they asked me for names in the organisation who joined as L61 with your YOE. I had few friends so I named them. Then he said he will check with team again.
Please any tips on negotiation.
