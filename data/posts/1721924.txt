Hi Folks, I have offers from Swiggy and PhonePe. Following are the details -
YOE - 5+
Swiggy - Compensation
Fixed : 46 LPA
Stocks - 25L for 4 years
Joining Bonus - 7L
PhonePe - Compensation
Fixed - 46LPA
Stocks - 50k USD vested for 4 years
Joining bonus - 5L
Retention Bouns - 5L
Considering both offer have almost similar compensation. I want to focus on the other aspects like WLB and culture. In terms of the culture I have heard good things about the Flipkart owned companies like - Myntra, PhonePe.
If you guys have got any pointers with respect to culture, WLB and work pressure in both companies, please help me out here.
Interview experience - Coming up soon.
