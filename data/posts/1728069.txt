Hello Everyone.
I actually recieved an offer from a startup a month back and I accepted it (and joinning is in 2 weeks) but yesterday I recieved another offer which is better from the previous one. I really like the first company so wanted to re-negotiate the offer but it's been a month. Is it too late to re-negotiate now or is it fine to do it now?
It's my first time ever as am a recent graduate so I am not sure how everything functions.
Geniuenly looking for help from the Leetcode Community!
Any suggestions are appreciated, Thanks.
