Hi All,

Wanted to know anyone is working at fareye and how is the WLB and growth perspective

Can any one worked on any company can tell which one is better both interms on career, WLB, Growth perseptive.
Some companies are in pipeline ( NoBroker, Pharmeasy..). Still I have 1 month notice period to join any of the company. I almost F..ked up from past 3 months by giving interviews and rejections. I tierd of trying new companies I want to relax for month.
