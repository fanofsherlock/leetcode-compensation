Hi All,
My Exp: 3.6 years
I got two offers
Well Know fintTech Company
Growing startup ( founded in 2013) ( recently raised $100M funding )
Compensation:
FinTech:
Base: 27 LPA
Bonus: 2.5 LPA
LTA: 3.75LPA ( Every December)
Total CTC: 33.5 LPA
Startup
Base: 29 LPA
Bonus: 3 LPA
Esops: 10% of Base Every Year
Total CTC: 32 LPA + 10% Base Stocks(2.9LPA for First year)
My Doubt is Will Esops has value in future ? If I choose startup over fintech ?.
From News Its saying my 2022 Quarter 3 or 4 it will become unicorn. As far as i know Esops only worth once company goes to IPO otherwise its just a paper money.
How long it will take a company to go to IPO or Any way to cash Esops cash to real cash ?
So any suggestions which one to choose ? LTA or Esops ?
