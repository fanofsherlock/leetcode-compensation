Would like to hear the thoughts of the community on this.
I know it looks like a good offer, but think from 2 perspectives -
There is not a huge bump being offered over my current comp
I am concerned about OCI. I've worked with only the top 4 firms so far so also worried that this might be a step down on my profile.
lol downvoters, can you explain why you are downvoting the post? What can OP do to help improve this?<br>---
