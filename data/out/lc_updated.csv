I carefully heard recruiter's initial offer, and negotiated it then and there. Later, after a little increase in the offer, I still asked for more time to analyse the offer and do more research. Post that, I scheduled another call to negotiate further. I am mentioning all this just to remind everyone to:

Other details: Didn't negotiate yet. Don't have any competing offers as all my interviews are lined up in the next few weeks. This was supposed to be my ""warm up"" interview.
But I think, this offer is good and will most probably accept.

A couple of people have commented asking about my experience, career path and advice for juniors. I'm adding some more details and my thoughts here,
In my 7 YOE, I spent 4.5 years in a very early stage no-name startup. Though I was paid less here, my learnings were huge. I was responsible for whole end to end tech stack and it helped me get so much experience which would not be possible in big companies/startups. This was the main reason I was able to clear system design interviews with ease. As I had hands-on experience in each system design aspect, I did not need much preparation for that. So, in early career, join a startup with good engineering foundation and learn. It does not matter if startup fails or succeeds, you are still very young and can try out different paths at this stage.
This is not an outlier offer. This is standard for SDE 4 and above in many companies. As you could see the breakup, stocks take up a good amount of portion. InMobi is going for IPO next year. So I belive stocks would appreciate later.
Please do proper research about market standard on bli-d and other salary discussion threads. InMobi is a good company as they did not try to low-ball me and compensated me purely based on interview feedback. I was surprised to hear this number but I got to know later from bli-d posts that this was a standard offer. If I had competing offers, this number would have gone even higher.
Before a few years, I was on the same path as most of you, reading compensation threads and wondering even if they were real. But as I progressed on my career, I came to know that these numbers are very real and they are not out of reach for anybody. Just focus on your career and the money follows.",inmobi,sde 4,7,"55,00,000 base",": 71,00,000 (with stocks)",bangalore,inmobi,sde 4,bangalore,7.0,5500000.0,7100000.0

I've been told that curefit gives hike in every 6 months and 99% folks get it around 10%
Is the info correct / accurate?
No titles in curefit | flat hierarchy.
curefit ESOPs are barely of any use. Company have never done any buybacks and I don't think they'll even think for IPO in next 7-8 years. Hence, this is just paper money.
My Priority:
Pay >= Engineering work (Good problems to solve) > WLB and culture matters > company brand (help me for next switch :) > smart folks in the team
Edit1: As of now I am inclined towards joining Curefit. Scale is high but comparatively lower than Razorpay. But their is considerable monetory difference (after 3 yrs) , which I don't want to miss :) But again, will decide in before EOW.
Edit2:
Base/Fixed (Calculating based on standards given by each company) as many people might not consider monetory motivation for these offers.

Edit3: Other offers:

I have learnt that GoJek transport team is also very good, also the culture is good in GoJek. The only problem is attrition is high (which I believe is everywhere)
Hence, the decision now becomes more difficult :P
Edit4:
Curefit revised offer
Base: 42L
JB: 5L
Esops: 20L
TC : ~51 LPA/year
Rejected Razorpay as the pay was quite less and team was not exciting. I had to work on migration part from PHP -> Go. Need to decide between Gojek & CureFit. Work at Gojek is in transport team (Uber/Ola) and I'll will be working on a new project from scratch.

Other Details :
Negotiate better, I didn't have any competing offer so couldn't negotiate. Although, I mentioned during the comp call that I am in the final rounds of a couple of reputed product-based companies (two were faangs) . Probably, that helped me get a sign-on bonus and a little raise on the base
For stocks, they can be vested 25% per year for 4 years. 25% can be vested after the end of first year of employment with them. Thereafter, from second year onwards, can vest 6.25% each quarter (i.e. 25% for an year)
Comp is based on interview performance too
Didn't add interview experience, please comment if anyone wants it
Questions :
Should I accept this offer? Is there room for more negotiation? If yes, then in which component?
Amazon's interviews are still pending, is it worth waiting? Personally sepaking, their 2-3 lacs increase in base is not worth the bad WLB
Does anyone know about the overall culture and WLB at Expedia? Would be great if you could provide some insights.
Is the offer as per industry standards?
Edit :
Added interview experience.

Considering my experience and college, on't know how they can ignore all these things, and above of all when I said that it is very low considering my experience so he said that experience is not the only thing.
I said I need time I am waiting MS noida and PayPal offer but 61 is very low.
On this he tried pressurizing me by getting angry that how can you apply for 2 locations, offer for other one will be freezer and you will only have one offer. I said how can I decide on Noida's one if I don't even get to see the numbers in case it gets freezed.
On this he said that numbers will be same, I was like what he is saying. Level of interview was different, panel was different, team is different so how come the numbers will be same.
This is the way they treat candidates just to ensure that they get hired in such a low package and struggle inside to grow.
Please suggest what should I do, can it be possible that he might manipulate other offer (I had already discussed this with Noida's HR that I have just completed Hyderabad's event so can I again give the interviews on which she said yes",microsoft,se 2/l61,8+,27 lpa,": 50,52,000 lpa",hyderabad,microsoft,sde 2,hyderabad,8.0,2700000.0,5052000.0

This seems like a lowball to me as per my expectations, Can anyone help me to confirm if someone has joined recently as a SDE 2 and what have you been offered? I was expecting the base to be atleast 22+ L.
Also, would you suggest to join Walmart (Bangalore) over Paypal if they offer slightly more than Paypal? I don't have the numbers yet but let's say INR 2-3L more. You can also give feedback regarding work and culture.

I believe i should work a few more years before joining a company I'd like to settle down in

Other Details:- I haven't accepted the offer yet, waiting for some more interviews.
What do you guys think should I make this switch?
Considering that in my current organization there is nothing bad its all chilled out, I mainly started looking out as the works is more like that of an SRE and I was and am interested in core backend development. Otherwise I don't see any cons, people are knowledgable and chilled and are concerned about work getting done and not the hours you sit(had some prior experience like this). Also in terms of WFH and flexiblity the organization is pretty chilled out. And people who have been here for 3-4 years have really grown in ladders.
The benefit I see in Hotstar is their stack is JAVA which I haven't worked in previously and I believe many companies are still mostly JAVA based. The compensation seems okay and HR told me that some Disney stocks may get included later on(no guarentee). And scale seems really good. This may help in future.
Is the compensation good enough?

Updates:
I decided to go with Adobe. I decided this because of the following reasons:
Project -- I asked both of them to setup a call with the to-be-managers so that I could have a discussion on the kind of work I'd do and the project I'd be working on. Adobe did that twice. Cohesity's HR asked me to first accept the offer. Only then they would schedule the call. I rejected their offer and the call was setup the very day.
Compensation -- Cohesity's stock value was ambiguous. Since I'm the sole earning member of the family, I wanted surity in the Covid times.
Work Life Balance -- People usually tend to burn out the initial few years in startups where there is huge learning potential, and then switch to settled companies in the later years when the pressure of raising a family comes up. However,I live at home and I didn't want to spend all the time working without having the leisure to enjoy snack and chat times with my family (this is my personal POV. I'm sure many would disagree, and I respect their opinion as well).

Should I wait for promotion at Amazon and decline the offer at MS? I might get promoted in next 8 months or so, hopefully. Also, how is the promotion speed at MS?
Should I switch to MS and then work on getting promoted there or stay at Amazon, get promoted and then switch ?
